  <p>How this Political Economy Graduate is Helping the Fight Against COVID19</p>
<p>The world is facing a global pandemic. Those at home have been groping for ways to help. Many do what they can from the comforts of their home: sending informative Viber messages, being the “taumbahay”, and silently sustaining the economy from home. While others put themselves in harm’s way just to help frontliners, the message of all the governments of the world is clear and simple: stay home and save lives. In the Philippines, we have something similar: bayan muna, bahay muna. It’s a resounding message -- It’s simply not worth the risk. 

Some are more inclined to risk than others.</p>
<p>Patricia Louise Dy, a Political Economy graduate of UA&P, is one such person. To date, she has spearheaded four initiatives to combat the adverse effects of COVID19 on the most affected. Most notable of these is kapitPH, a non-profit organization Patricia and her friends started in response to COVID19 which has raised close to one million pesos, the sum of which is being used to help the frontliners in the battle against COVID19.</p>
<p>Below is the transcript of our interview:</p>
<p>Marco: I’ve been following kapitPH for a few weeks now. I’m really impressed with how you guys have managed the donation drive. It’s all very transparent and professional. I can’t help but think that the way KapitPH is run is how relief operations should be done. What prompted you to start KapitPH?</p>
<p>Pat: A group of friends and I felt restless during the height of the pandemic. We all know that the best thing we can do is to stay at home but it's really difficult knowing that there are many Filipinos who don't have enough resources to get through the following weeks and months because for them, social distancing isn't really an option. That's when we decided to start KapitPH so that we could enable people to help low-income communities and daily wage earners to stay afloat during this time. In particular, we’re helping out specific downtrodden baranggays in Quezon City -- the place most badly hit by COVID19.</p>
<p>Marco: Since you guys are adopting a baranggay-centered approach, what difference does it make if I were to help the baranggay relief efforts, as opposed to the more national level relief approaches?</p>
<p>Pat: From a bottom up perspective, a barangay is the closest link there is to reaching the masses/communities that has little to no voice in an epidemic like this. The baranggay level is the closest link we have to the pulse of the people: who needs what, where and when. If you course relief efforts through bigger organizations like the government, a lot of the efforts is expended on the bureaucracy, unfortunately, and not enough is given to actually helping the frontlines.</p>
<p>Marco: KapitPH is an interesting name. Where did you guys get it?</p>
<p>Pat: “Kapit" in Tagalog means "to hold on" — words of encouragement we want to spread to our Filipino brothers and sisters. While known for their remarkable optimism in times of adversity, Filipinos are not immune to hard times, and it’s crucial to come together as a community to lift each other up now more than ever. KapitPH aims to bring important issues to light and allow the rest of the world to extend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Marco: What do your operations look like? I am amazed at how efficient KapitPH is in managing its resources and gathering donors. Following the KapitPH Instagram page is like being led through the whole process -- from donations to the frontlines receiving the relief. Is this your first time running a relief operation?</p>
<p>Pat: We raise funds to enable Filipinos in Manila and abroad to feed over 6,000 families in Barangay Tandang Sora, a highly-quarantined low-income community suffering gravely from the COVID-19 outbreak in the Philippines. Our team comprises four members. Teri Arejola and Max Kho, who are based in New York, focus on marketing and project management. Darleen Sy and I, who are based in Manila, focus on logistics and operations.</p>
<p>We're in contact with Baranggay Tandang Sora’s Captain Marlou C. Ulanday who receives the relief packages. The frontliners in their barangay are the ones manually distributing the goods to the indigent communities.  I think our team has made a great example on how we can use technology and social media as an instrument to aid those who have less means in times like these.</p>
<p>Marco: Plenty stay at home and feel like they’re doing enough to help mitigate the spread of the disease. Your team in KapitPH, on the other hand, risk life and limb to get the relief where it needs to be. Where did you get your civic consciousness? Did studying Political Economy at UA&P nourish this civic-mindedness?</p>
<p>Pat: We learned a lot of theory in Political Economy. In order to apply the theory, we needed to see how it fits in real-world scenarios. This skill and mindset that was nourished during my study in political economy that is, concretizing the abstract, definitely planted the seeds of my civic engagement. At first, it was as simple as reading the news and journal articles to write a paper. Little by little, you find yourself growing more concerned for the state of the nation. So in the end, yes. I think studying Political Economy helped me in that regard.</p>
<p>Marco: Do you have anything to say for the people reading this piece? How can they help?</p>
<p>Pat: It’s still startling to think what sort of situation we’re in. We’re living through history right now. My challenge for everyone reading this is that these things happen once in a lifetime. People are suffering, and yet, there is a tremendous opportunity, particularly for the wealthy, to do good to our fellow Filipinos. Now, if at all, is the time to give until it hurts.</p>
<p>Patricia Louise Dy graduated from the AB Political Economy program in UA&P in 2016. Apart from founding Kapit, she is also a Kagawad of the Sanguniang Kabataan of San Juan City. She is also partaking in donation drives for her high school alma mater, Immaculate Conception Academy (ICA). Finally, her art gallery, The Grey Space, has been holding online auctions for the benefit of the frontliners.</p>
